# CDD Contest

This is the github repository of a contest managed by '[Caf√© des Devs](https://discord.com/cafedesdevs)', a french discord server which is a community of developers.

This contest is a design-implementation contest. You have to make the most **optimized** and **easy-to-read** website.
I personally wanted to push the challenge even further and have a clean development environment with a fully optimized final build.
